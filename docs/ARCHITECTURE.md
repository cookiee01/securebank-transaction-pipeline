# SecureBank Transaction Pipeline - Architecture Guide

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

The SecureBank Transaction Pipeline implements a modern, cloud-native architecture using AWS serverless services. The system is designed for high throughput, low latency, and automatic scaling while maintaining strong security and compliance posture.

## 📐 Architectural Principles

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Decouple components using events
- **Reactive Scaling**: Scale based on actual demand
- **Fault Tolerance**: Isolated failures don't cascade

### 2. Serverless-First
- **No Infrastructure Management**: Focus on business logic
- **Automatic Scaling**: From zero to thousands of requests
- **Pay-per-Use**: Cost optimization through usage-based pricing

### 3. Microservices Pattern
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be updated independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Choose best tool for each job

### 4. Security by Design
- **Zero Trust**: Verify every request and access
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Data protection at rest and in transit
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

## 🏛️ Component Architecture

### 1. Ingestion Layer

#### API Gateway
```yaml

  Type: REST API
  Authentication: AWS_IAM + API Keys
  Throttling: 10,000 requests/second
  Caching: 5-minute TTL for read operations
  
Endpoints:
  - POST /v1/transactions
  - GET /v1/transactions/{id}
  - GET /v1/health
  
Security:
  - Request validation
  - Rate limiting per client
  - CORS enabled for web clients
```

#### Kinesis Data Streams
```yaml

  Stream Name: securebank-transactions
  Shard Count: 4 (auto-scaling enabled)
  Retention Period: 24 hours
  Encryption: Server-side with KMS
  
Partitioning Strategy:
  Partition Key: customer_id
  Benefits: 
    - Even distribution across shards
    - Customer transactions stay in order
    - Parallel processing capability
```

### 2. Processing Layer

    weight: 0.2
    
  time_anomaly:
    description: "Transaction at unusual time"
    threshold: Outside 6 AM - 10 PM

## 📊 Performance Architecture

### Scalability Patterns
```yaml
Auto Scaling:
  API Gateway: Automatic (10,000 RPS default)
  Lambda: Concurrent executions (1,000 reserved)
  DynamoDB: On-demand scaling
  Kinesis: Auto-scaling enabled (2-40 shards)

Optimization Strategies:
  Lambda:
    - Provisioned concurrency for critical functions
    - Connection pooling for database access
    - Efficient memory allocation (512MB optimal)
    
  DynamoDB:
    - Composite keys for even data distribution
    - Sparse indexes for cost optimization
    - DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for read-heavy workloads
    
  S3:
    - Intelligent tiering for cost optimization
    - Transfer acceleration for global access
    - Multipart uploads for large objects
```

### Caching Strategy
```yaml
Levels:
  API Gateway: 5-minute cache for read operations
  Lambda: In-memory caching for customer profiles
  DynamoDB: DAX for microsecond latency
  Athena: Query result caching (24 hours)

Cache Invalidation:
  - Time-based expiration
  - Event-driven invalidation
  - Manual cache busting for urgent updates
```

## 🔄 Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
```yaml
DynamoDB:
  Point-in-time Recovery: Enabled (35 days)
  On-demand Backups: Weekly full backups
  Cross-region Replication: For critical tables
  
S3:
  Versioning: Enabled on all buckets
  Cross-region Replication: Critical data only
  Lifecycle Policies: Transition to IA/Glacier
  
Recovery Objectives:
  RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 1 hour
  RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 5 minutes
```

### Multi-Region Architecture (Future)
```yaml
Primary Region: us-east-1
Secondary Region: us-west-2

Replication:
  DynamoDB: Global tables
  S3: Cross-region replication
  Lambda: Identical deployments
  
Failover:
  Route 53: Health checks and DNS failover
  Lambda: Cross-region invocation capability
  Data: Eventual consistency acceptable
```

```

### Resource Rightsizing
```yaml
Lambda:
  Memory: Start with 512MB, optimize based on CloudWatch
  Timeout: Minimum required (typically 30 seconds)
  
DynamoDB:
  Capacity: On-demand for variable workloads
  Indexes: Only create necessary GSIs/LSIs
  
Kinesis:
